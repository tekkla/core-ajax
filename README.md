#Core/Ajax
A php/javascript library to perform ajax requests from any html element, handling them inside PHP and offering the opportunity to return a set of commands that will be parsed and called inside the javascript ajax handler. This gives you the ability to perfom javascript actions from PHP side.

## Getting started

You need PHP >= 7 to an jQuery >= 1.12.4 to use Core/Ajax.
